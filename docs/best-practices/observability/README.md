# Observability Best Practices

## 1. Purpose
Provide visibility into system health, performance, and reliability.

## 2. Core Principles

- Instrument everything
- Correlate logs, metrics, and traces
- Automate alerting and remediation
- Design for failure detection

## 3. Industry Standards & Frameworks

- OpenTelemetry
- SRE golden signals
- ITIL incident management

## 4. Common Patterns

- Centralized logging
- Distributed tracing
- Metrics dashboards

## 5. Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Alert fatigue
- Logging without structure
- Monitoring only infrastructure, not business KPIs

## 6. Tooling & Ecosystem

- Prometheus, Grafana
- ELK/EFK stack
- Jaeger, Zipkin

## 7. Emerging Trends

- AIOps
- Continuous profiling
- Observability-as-code

## 8. Architecture Decision Guidance

- Define SLIs, SLOs, SLAs early.
- Balance observability depth with cost.
