# Volatility-Based Decomposition

## 1. Purpose

Organize software components based on their rate of change to minimize ripple effects, improve maintainability, and enable independent evolution of system parts.

## 2. Core Principle

**Separate components that change for different reasons or at different rates.**

Components with similar volatility characteristics should be grouped together, while components with different volatility rates should be isolated from each other through stable interfaces.

## 3. Volatility Categories

### High Volatility Components
**Characteristics:**
- Change frequently (weekly/monthly)
- Business rules and policies
- UI/UX implementations
- Marketing and promotional logic
- A/B testing features
- Regulatory compliance rules

**Examples:**
- Pricing algorithms
- Discount calculation rules
- User interface themes
- Campaign management logic
- Feature flags and toggles

### Medium Volatility Components
**Characteristics:**
- Change periodically (quarterly/semi-annually)
- Application services and workflows
- Integration adapters
- Reporting and analytics
- Configuration management

**Examples:**
- Order processing workflows
- Payment integration services
- Notification delivery systems
- Report generation engines
- Data transformation pipelines

### Low Volatility Components
**Characteristics:**
- Rarely change (annually or less)
- Core infrastructure
- Framework libraries
- Data access patterns
- Security primitives
- Logging and monitoring foundations

**Examples:**
- Database connection pooling
- Authentication/authorization infrastructure
- Caching mechanisms
- Message queue abstractions
- Logging frameworks

## 4. Decomposition Strategies

### Strategy 1: Layered Isolation
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│   High Volatility Layer             │  ← Business Rules
│   (Isolated, Frequent Changes)      │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│   Stable Interfaces                 │  ← Contracts
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│   Medium Volatility Layer           │  ← Application Services
│   (Moderate, Predictable Changes)   │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│   Stable Interfaces                 │  ← Contracts
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│   Low Volatility Layer              │  ← Infrastructure
│   (Stable, Rare Changes)            │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Strategy 2: Plugin Architecture
- Core system (low volatility)
- Plugin interfaces (stable contracts)
- Plugins (high volatility business logic)

### Strategy 3: Rules Engine Pattern
- Rules engine (low volatility)
- Rule definitions (high volatility)
- Rule execution context (medium volatility)

### Strategy 4: Configuration-Driven
- Application framework (low volatility)
- Configuration schema (medium volatility)
- Configuration values (high volatility)

## 5. Implementation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Dependency Inversion
```csharp
// Low volatility - Stable abstraction
namespace Core.Abstractions;

public interface IPricingStrategy
{
    decimal Calculate(Order order);
}

// High volatility - Business rule implementation
namespace Business.Pricing;

public class SeasonalPricingStrategy : IPricingStrategy
{
    public decimal Calculate(Order order)
    {
        // Seasonal rules change frequently
        return order.Season == Season.Holiday 
            ? order.BasePrice * 0.85m 
            : order.BasePrice;
    }
}

// Medium volatility - Application service
namespace Application.Services;

public class OrderService(IPricingStrategy pricingStrategy)
{
    public async Task<decimal> CalculateTotalAsync(Order order)
    {
        return pricingStrategy.Calculate(order);
    }
}
```

### Pattern 2: Strategy Pattern with Registry
```csharp
// Low volatility - Registry infrastructure
namespace Core.Infrastructure;

public class StrategyRegistry<TStrategy>
{
    private readonly Dictionary<string, TStrategy> strategies = new();
    
    public void Register(string key, TStrategy strategy) =>
        strategies[key] = strategy;
    
    public TStrategy Get(string key) =>
        strategies.TryGetValue(key, out var strategy) 
            ? strategy 
            : throw new KeyNotFoundException($"Strategy '{key}' not found");
}

// High volatility - Strategy implementations
namespace Business.Rules;

public class PremiumDiscountStrategy : IDiscountStrategy
{
    public decimal Apply(decimal amount) => amount * 0.15m;
}

public class StandardDiscountStrategy : IDiscountStrategy
{
    public decimal Apply(decimal amount) => amount * 0.10m;
}
```

### Pattern 3: External Configuration
```csharp
// Low volatility - Configuration loader
namespace Core.Configuration;

public class RulesConfigurationLoader
{
    public async Task<RulesConfiguration> LoadAsync(string source)
    {
        // Stable loading mechanism
        var json = await File.ReadAllTextAsync(source);
        return JsonSerializer.Deserialize<RulesConfiguration>(json)!;
    }
}

// High volatility - Configuration content (external JSON/YAML)
// {
//   "discountRules": [
//     { "customerType": "Premium", "percentage": 15 },
//     { "customerType": "Standard", "percentage": 10 }
//   ]
// }
```

## 6. Dependency Management

### Dependency Direction Rule
**High volatility → Medium volatility → Low volatility**

- High volatility components depend on medium/low volatility abstractions
- Medium volatility components depend on low volatility abstractions
- Low volatility components have minimal dependencies

### Anti-Pattern: Inverted Dependencies
```csharp
// ❌ BAD: Low volatility depending on high volatility
namespace Core.Infrastructure;

public class DatabaseContext
{
    // Infrastructure depending on business rules - BAD!
    public void ApplyDiscount(Order order, PremiumDiscountStrategy strategy) { }
}

// ✅ GOOD: Low volatility depends on stable abstraction
namespace Core.Infrastructure;

public class DatabaseContext
{
    // Infrastructure depending on stable interface - GOOD!
    public void ApplyDiscount(Order order, IDiscountStrategy strategy) { }
}
```

## 7. Testing Strategies

### High Volatility Components
- **Extensive unit tests** (frequent changes require quick feedback)
- **Property-based testing** for business rules
- **A/B testing** in production
- **Feature flag** testing

### Medium Volatility Components
- **Integration tests** (verify component interactions)
- **Contract tests** (ensure interface stability)
- **End-to-end tests** for critical workflows

### Low Volatility Components
- **Minimal unit tests** (focus on edge cases)
- **Performance tests** (stability is key)
- **Security tests** (infrastructure security)

## 8. Versioning and Release Strategies

### High Volatility
- Frequent deployments (daily/weekly)
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Independent versioning
- Hotfix-friendly architecture

### Medium Volatility
- Regular release cycles (sprint-based)
- API versioning
- Backward compatibility windows
- Deprecation notices

### Low Volatility
- Infrequent updates (quarterly/annually)
- Major version changes only
- Long-term support (LTS) versions
- Extensive migration guides

## 9. Organizational Alignment

### Team Structure
- **High Volatility Teams**: Product-focused, domain experts, fast iteration
- **Medium Volatility Teams**: Application developers, cross-functional
- **Low Volatility Teams**: Platform engineers, infrastructure specialists

### Ownership Model
- High volatility: Product teams own and evolve rapidly
- Medium volatility: Shared ownership with platform teams
- Low volatility: Centralized platform/infrastructure teams

## 10. Real-World Examples

### E-Commerce System
```
High Volatility:
- Promotional campaigns
- Pricing rules
- Recommendation algorithms
- UI themes and layouts

Medium Volatility:
- Checkout workflow
- Payment gateway integration
- Order fulfillment process
- Email notification templates

Low Volatility:
- Database connection pooling
- Authentication framework
- Logging infrastructure
- Cache abstraction layer
```

### Financial Trading Platform
```
High Volatility:
- Trading strategies
- Risk assessment rules
- Market data feeds
- Regulatory compliance checks

Medium Volatility:
- Order execution engine
- Portfolio management service
- Reporting and analytics
- Client notification system

Low Volatility:
- Message queue infrastructure
- Database sharding logic
- Security and encryption
- Audit logging framework
```

## 11. Metrics and Indicators

### Change Frequency Metrics
- **Commits per month** per component
- **Deployment frequency** per service
- **Feature flag toggles** per module

### Stability Metrics
- **Time between changes** (longer = more stable)
- **Breaking changes count** (fewer = more stable)
- **Dependency updates** (fewer = more stable)

### Impact Metrics
- **Blast radius** of changes (smaller = better isolation)
- **Ripple effect** across components (less = better decomposition)
- **Hotfix frequency** (fewer = better stability)

## 12. Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Anti-Pattern 1: Mixed Volatility
```csharp
// ❌ BAD: High and low volatility mixed
public class OrderProcessor
{
    // Low volatility - infrastructure
    private readonly IDbConnection connection;
    
    // High volatility - business rule
    private decimal CalculateSeasonalDiscount(Order order)
    {
        return order.Season == Season.Holiday ? 0.20m : 0.0m;
    }
    
    // Medium volatility - workflow
    public async Task ProcessAsync(Order order) { }
}
```

### Anti-Pattern 2: God Component
A single component that handles all volatility levels becomes a bottleneck for change.

### Anti-Pattern 3: Premature Abstraction
Creating complex abstraction layers before understanding actual volatility patterns.

### Anti-Pattern 4: Volatility Inversion
High volatility components providing interfaces to low volatility components.

## 13. Migration Strategies

### Identify Volatility
1. Analyze version control history (commit frequency)
2. Track change requests and feature updates
3. Review deployment frequency
4. Measure time-to-production for changes

### Refactor Incrementally
1. Extract high volatility code first
2. Create stable interfaces
3. Move to plugin/strategy pattern
4. Externalize configuration

### Validate Decomposition
1. Measure deployment frequency improvement
2. Track reduction in cross-component changes
3. Monitor time-to-market for new features
4. Assess developer productivity

## 14. Best Practices

1. **Start with observation**: Track change frequency before decomposing
2. **Use stable interfaces**: Abstract volatile implementations behind contracts
3. **Version independently**: High volatility components need independent versioning
4. **Test appropriately**: Match testing strategy to volatility level
5. **Document volatility**: Make expected change rates explicit
6. **Review regularly**: Volatility patterns change over time
7. **Align teams**: Organize teams around volatility levels
8. **Automate deployment**: High volatility requires automation

## 16. Decision Framework

### When to Apply Volatility-Based Decomposition

**Good Fit:**
- Systems with frequent business rule changes
- Regulatory environments requiring rapid updates
- A/B testing and experimentation-heavy applications
- Multi-tenant systems with custom business logic
- Long-lived systems (5+ years expected lifespan)

**Poor Fit:**
- Small applications with uniform change rates
- Prototypes and proof-of-concepts
- Systems with purely technical volatility (no business rule changes)
- Applications with < 2 years expected lifespan

### Decision Checklist

- [ ] Have we measured actual change frequency?
- [ ] Are there clear volatility boundaries?
- [ ] Do we have organizational buy-in for separate team ownership?
- [ ] Can we maintain stable interfaces between layers?
- [ ] Will the benefits outweigh the additional complexity?
- [ ] Do we have appropriate testing strategies for each layer?
- [ ] Can we deploy components independently?

## 17. Conclusion

Volatility-based decomposition is a powerful architectural pattern that aligns system structure with the reality of change. By organizing code based on its rate of change rather than purely functional boundaries, teams can achieve:

- **Faster time-to-market** for high-volatility features
- **Reduced risk** when changing business rules
- **Better team autonomy** through clear ownership
- **Improved system stability** through isolation
- **Lower maintenance costs** over time

Success requires commitment to measuring change, maintaining stable interfaces, and continuously refining the decomposition as the system evolves.
